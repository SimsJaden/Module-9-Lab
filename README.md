# CS408 - Module 9 Ball Game

## Overview

This project includes a ball game based on the project description given to us for the lab 9 assignment. In addition the given starter files, I went and added
some extra modes for the ball game and some effects I thought would be pretty cool. Have fun!

## Special Additions
Normal Mode only starts with 25 balls that you collect with the evil circles.
Mayhem Mode starts with 100 balls and adds a ball every 3 seconds. The goal is to collect all the balls without taking to long or you'll be forced to need to capture more.
Reset Button resets the game to the original 25 balls and no spawn additions.
A button that adds a computer controlled ball to help you.
Lastly a remove button for those CPU evil circles in case you want to attempt it without them.
